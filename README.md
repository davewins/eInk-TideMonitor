# eInk-TideMonitor

Using the ESP32 with e-Ink display, I wanted to print out the tide times for a place I visit often so I can just put it on the door so I can easily see what the tide is up to.

I used an RSS feed from https://www.tidetimes.org.uk and the TinyXML library to parse the feed. I used the case from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4670205 and of course some inspiration from the code.
